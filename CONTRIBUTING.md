If you have spotted a bug:
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/HariboDev/aws-ec2-profiles/issues)
- Include what the problem is
- Include steps to reproduce the problem.

## Coding conventions
Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimise for readability:
- Variable names are camel case (e.g. `var myFirstVariable = ""`)
- Function names are camel case (e.g. `function myFirstFunction() {}`)
- Indent using 2 spaces
- Use spaces after list and method parameters (e.g. `[1, 2, 3]` not `[1,2,3]`) and around operators (e.g. `x += 1` not `x+=1`).

## Commit conventions
Make sure to follow our commit guidlines if you wish to [make a pull request](https://github.com/HariboDev/aws-ec2-profiles/pulls):
- Include a single add (`+`) to tell us when you added a feature (e.g. `+ Added a new feature`)
- Include a single minux (`-`) to tell us when you removed a feature (e.g. `- Removed an old feature`).

Thanks.
