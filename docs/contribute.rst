A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to AWS EC2 Profiles (AEP).

You've come to the right place if you looking to:

* Report a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

We Develop with GitHub
======================

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well
as accept pull requests.

üì£ Discussions
===============

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a
great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our
docs, join us in `discussions`_.

üêû Issues
==========

`Issues`_ should be used to report problems with the tool, its documentation,
request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is
created.

If you've found a problem described above, search open issues to see if
someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open
an issue using a `template`_. We'll use the issue to have a conversation
about the problem you've highlighted.

If you find an issue that addresses the same problem you're having, please
add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than
creating a new one. Adding a `reaction`_ can indicate to our maintainers
that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

üõ†Ô∏è Pull Requests
=================

A `pull request`_ is a way to suggest changes to AEP.

When opening a pull request, it must be accompanied by a complete pull request
template.

When we merge those changes, they will be available in the next release of
AEP.

In general, follow the `fork-and-pull Git workflow`_:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit the changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository

üìú Licensing
=============

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood
to be under the same `MIT License`_ that covers the project. Feel free
to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
